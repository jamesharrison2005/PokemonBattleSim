very simple and basic Pokémon battle simulator to help learn Python using PokeAPI\
--NOTES--\
This is a small project to improve my knowledge of APIS and Python\
Because of this, there are a few known crucial bugs\
Status effect moves do not work there a simple damage calculation, so moves which affect stats don't do anything.\
Moves which impact the other Pokémon as well don't wor,k for example self-destruct only does damage, it will not faint the 
Pokémon using it.
