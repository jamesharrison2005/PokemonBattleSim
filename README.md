very simple and basic pokemon battle simulator to help learn python using PokeAPI
--NOTES--
This is a small project to imporve my knowledge of APIS and python
because of this there are a few known crucial bugs
status effect moves do not work there a simple damage calculation so moves which effect stats dont do anything.
Moves which impact the other pokemonas well dont work for example self destruct only does damage it will not faint the 
pokemopn using it.
